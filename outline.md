## The Current State of Last-Mile Delivery
**Time**: 2 mins  
**Slide**: Crappy warehouse photo  
**Content**:
<!-- - The Valentines day story is a good example of  -->
- To talk about the current state is complicated, since there is a **huge discrepancy** between state-of-the-art and the industry average.
<!-- - As everyone here knows: Last-mile is the majority of transport cost -->
<!-- - Cost per delivery varies hugely, even within the same type of deliveries in the same geography -->
- State of the Art vs Industry Average
    - Route Planning
    - Loading Dock + WH layout
    - Real-Time Tracking + Changes
    - Proof of Delivery
    - Customer Communication
- Impact on 
    - Cost per delivery
    - Delivery speed
    - Customer Satisfaction
    - Environment

## Last-Mile Delivery in 2030
**Time**: 4 mins  
**Slide**: Futuristic photo of a delivery vehicle  
**Content**:

- First, let's talk about the trends in Last-mile delivery, so we can then look at how delivery managemement will need to adapt.

- Drones: "I'm not going to focus on this."
    - flying (capacity issue, proven rarely useful)
    - driving (basically same as AVs)
    - in-warehouse
- Electric vehicles (range, environment)
- Autonomous vehicles 
    - massive cost reduction
    - removes limits of human drivers (labour laws)
- In-sourcing, Out-sourcing, Hybrid
    - In source cheaper if you have the volume/density
    - Out-source lets you service everywhere
- Delivery Partner Networks
    - How to compete with Amazon: collaborate

- Micro-Fulfillment Centers (MFCs) or dark stores
- Mobile Cross-Dock (?)
- Smart WH Layout + Dock
<!-- Mention other emerging trends that you anticipate, such as increased use of predictive analytics and real-time tracking technology. -->


## Delivery Management: The Great Enabler
**Time**: 4 mins  
**Slide**: Generic image of modern logistics software  
**Content**:

For many of the futures we mentioned, Delivery Management Systems needs to keep up!
- With AVs, you can't just call the driver to ask where she is!
- With out-sourced deliveries, how do you keep track?
- How do you aggregate data across MFCs? Or know which one to dispatch from?
<!-- - And, of course, mobile cross-dock can't work without real-time tracking and planning -->

So what **does** it look like?
- Real-time tracking is the base
- Integrations. Not sexy, but this is one of the KEY issues.
- Plan based on predictions
- Reactive Algorithms - respond to changes
    - Traffic
    - Road closures
    - Early/late drivers
- MFCs, and WH layout: Route planning integrated with Inventory system.
- Customer communication: Channel of choice


## Striving for best practices
**Time**: 1 min  
**Slide**: Huge dollar sign or money  
**Content**:

- Many of our prospects have "reasons" why they cannot move towards best practices. (tight order cutoffs, warehouse layout issues, etc)
- But they are the ones that are losing deals. Losing customers. Losing money.
- The ones that are winning are the ones that are striving for best practices.

## Conclusion
**Time**: 1 min  
**Slide**: Name or logo?  
**Content**:
- Last mile in 2030 will be different, but not that different
- The key to success will be to ensure your systems can keep up with the changes
