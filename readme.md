## Delivery Management: The Great Enabler
**Time**: 9:00 -> 15:00

DMS needs to keep up
- Drones, AVs: You can't call the driver
- EVs: Shorter routes, plan for charging
- In/Outsourcing, DPNs: Integrations
- AVs: Reactive algorithms -> route replanning, traffic, early/late
- MFCs: Route planning integrated with Inventory
- Customer Communication: Channel of choice


## Catch up to 2023 first
**Time**: 15:00 -> 16:00

- If you're still delivering like I did on valentines day 2014, YOU'RE IN 2014!!
- Reasons vs Excuses: contracts, $, customer satisfaction
- The ones that are winning are the ones that are striving for best practices despite excuses.


## Conclusion
